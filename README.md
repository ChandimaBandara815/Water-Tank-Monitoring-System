Water Level Monitoring System
This project is designed to automate water level monitoring and pump control using an ESP8266 and Blynk app. It provides a real-time water level display and motor (pump) control, enhancing water management for households, industries, or farms.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Water levels are measured with an ultrasonic sensor and displayed in the Blynk app.
Automated Pump Control: Automatically manage the water pump based on predefined levels.
App Integration: Control the motor from anywhere via the Blynk app and get status updates.
LED Indicators: Visual water level indicators using LEDs for easy monitoring.
Components
ESP8266 NodeMCU
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Relay Module (for motor control)
5 LEDs for level indication
Jumper wires and breadboard
Blynk app (iOS/Android)
How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor detects water levels.
The data is sent to the Blynk app, where you can monitor the water level.
Use the app to manually or automatically turn the pump on/off.
LEDs provide a visual representation of water levels, while the motor status is updated live.
Installation & Usage
Upload the Arduino code to the ESP8266.
Connect components as shown in the wiring diagram.
Set up the Blynk app with the provided template.
Power up the system and monitor/control water levels remotely.
Future Enhancements
Integrate an alarm system for critical water levels.
Add scheduling for automatic pump control.
Feel free to contribute and improve this project!
